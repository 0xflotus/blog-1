We are excited to announce the release of the **Serverless Guide**, a definitive guide to serverless architectures. Inside, you will find everything you need to know about serverless development and how to be a serverless organization: patterns, best practices, case studies and everything in-between.

[![Serverless Guide](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/guide_hero_big.png)](https://github.com/serverless/guide)

Aside from implementation, this guide is a collection and discussion of concerns around the state and maturity of serverless. A lot is being written about serverless technology all over the web, and right now that information is fragmented. As a community, weâ€™re bringing it together.

> The goal is to create a one-of-a-kind, trusted resource for developers, architects and thought leaders. A valuable resource that will help drive adoption and innovation of serverless architectures.

The guide is an opensource, community-driven work and is a living artifact. It is a work in progress, with many [active contributors](https://github.com/serverless/guide/graphs/contributors). We are inviting all the serverless enthusiasts out there to contribute, share your experiences and spread the knowledge.

Are you with us? We want [you to be part](https://github.com/serverless/guide/blob/master/README.md#how-to-contribute) of this journey. We will be happy to hear from you and get your feedback.

> Start reading the [Serverless Guide](https://github.com/serverless/guide#table-of-contents) and spread the word.
