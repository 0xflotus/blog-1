# Releasing Serverless V.1 & Fundraising

For over a year now, we’ve been building an application framework to help developers spend less time operating complex infrastructure and more time delivering results.  To date, the Serverless Framework has garnered more than 11,000 stars on Github and hundreds of startups and enterprise users use it every week to deploy thousands of AWS Lambda functions.

Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re bringing Serverless Framework V.1 out of beta.  We’re also announcing we’ve closed a seed round of funding worth $3 million, led by Trinity Ventures.  With these funds, we’ll be able to substantially increase our efforts on the Framework and evolve its focus to help users deploy bigger, more powerful serverless architectures, across providers.

Here’s how to quickly get started with Serverless Framework V.1:

Graduating From Beta
In the beginning (Serverless Framework V.0), the key AWS services that comprise the Serverless Architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda, API Gateway) required a lot of assistance to use.  Today, they have all matured fantastically and most of their functionality is supported by AWS CloudFormation, allowing users to perform safer deployments of their functions and required resources.

In order for our users to take advantage of these new benefits, we started working on Serverless Framework V.1 Beta five months ago which relied entirely on AWS CloudFormation for deployments.  This change allowed us to focus more on developer experience and solving new challenges within the serverless architecture.

Since then, we’ve been building and testing Serverless Framework V.1 publicly.  The feedback is unanimously positive, and this has led our decision to bring it out of beta.
Open-Source
This fundraising wouldn’t have been possible without the power of open-source and the amazing community of developers who have submitted countless lines of code to make the Serverless Framework what it is. Therefore, our first order of business is simply to invest in more open source.

The Serverless Framework was born as and will always be open-source.  The majority of our new resources will be devoted to improving and expanding the Framework, engaging more closely with the community and improving our educational materials so people can better understand and realize the benefits of the serverless architecture.  Additionally, we plan to invest in more Framework related open-source side projects.
The Next Frontier
The “Serverless Movement” came out of nowhere and has grown quickly to become one of the leading buzzwords of 2016.  What has also grown is the number of companies offering serverless-like compute services, also known as Functions-as-a-Service.  These new entrants to the market are of interest because they represent new options we can present to our users.

AWS Lambda is the dominant player in the world of serverless computing, and rightfully so considering its level of maturity.  Our main goal is still to provide the greatest possible developer experience for AWS Lambda.  However, our new secondary goal is to review the current options for serverless computing, determine which ones give developers the most value (and the best “serverless” experience), and support them within the Framework.

We’re working closely with the major providers of other serverless compute offerings, and we look forward to announcing a few soon.
Thanks Again, Community
We wouldn’t have made it this far without our open-source community.  The amount of effort the community contributes every day amazes us.  Our next immediate priority is to start recognizing contributors more publicly and help promote them as the Serverless pioneers and experts they rightfully are.  We’ll be announcing our new champion program shortly.

Until then, take care and have fun building,

The Serverless Team






PRESS RELEASE *under embargo until 10/12 at 7:30am E.T.
Serverless, Inc. nets $3M to radically simplify cloud infrastructure
Trinity Ventures leads round to expand the most widely adopted application framework for building serverless architectures; Gains momentum amongst startups and Fortune 500 companies alike.

San Francisco -- October 12, 2016  -- Serverless, Inc., creators of the Serverless Framework, which enables companies to build web, mobile and IoT applications comprised of cloud services that scale automatically, has secured $3 million in seed funding led by Trinity Ventures.  The funds will further Serverless’ mission to help its users spend less time operating complex infrastructure and more time delivering results.

In addition, Serverless, Inc. has brought Serverless Framework V1.0 out of beta.  The Framework’s Beta has seen massive interest from the open-source community and has racked up more than 11,000 GitHub stars in one year.  It leverages new event-driven compute services like Amazon Web Services’ Lambda to deploy applications that scale continuously and bill their owner only when they run.  After being tested by hundreds of startup and enterprise companies, the Serverless Framework is ready for production.

“These are fast-moving times.  The operational and opportunity costs of maintaining complex systems is increasing.”, said Austen Collins, Founder and CEO at Serverless, Inc. “The Serverless Framework is for building software with an extremely low total cost of ownership.  That specific focus is what everyone is enthusiastic about.”

“ENTER QUOTE FROM TRINITY”

The Serverless Framework’s capacity to deliver more efficient applications has drawn a variety of use-cases, including data-processing pipelines that process billions of events and powering back-ends of high-profile websites for the likes of David Guetta that need to handle large, variable amounts of traffic.  The Framework has also attracted startups and Fortune 500 companies alike.

“The Serverless Framework is a core component of The Coca-Cola Company's initiative to reduce IT operational costs and deploy services faster,” said Patrick Brandt, Solutions Architect at The Coca-Cola Company.

Next, Serverless, Inc. will focus on supporting more cloud services into the Serverless Framework from the other major cloud providers, like Google, Azure and IBM, offering more choice, functionality and efficiency for its users.
