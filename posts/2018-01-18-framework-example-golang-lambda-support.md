Everyone, the day has come.

AWS Lambda is finally. Compatible. With Golang. ðŸ––

Here's how you can start using Go with the Serverless Framework RIGHT NOW and deploy Lambdas to your heart's content.

# Get Started

First things first, you'll be needing the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/) installed, and an [AWS account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/setting-up.html#setting-up-signup).

(If it's your first time using the Serverless Framework, our [first time deployment post](https://serverless.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-serverless-app/#setup) has a quick setup guide. Takes like 5 minutes, we promise.)

# Use the Go template

The Framework will configure AWS for Go on your behalf. Use this quick [serverless-golang template](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-golang) to deploy your first service.

Open up your terminal and let's create a new service with Go:
`serverless create -u https://github.com/serverless/serverless-golang/ -p myservice`

Compile the function:
`cd myservice
GOOS=linux go build -o bin/main`

...That's it! You can deploy now:
`serverless deploy`

# Why use Go for your Lambdas?

I just deployed a simple service with Go, and it is lightning fast: 0.76ms runtime.

This is really exciting; can't wait to see what the serverless community builds!
