We've been consistently honored and humbled by the incredible community support we receive for the Serverless Framework. In  such a short time, it has become a lively open source project with over 25,000 Github stars, and the number one way developers build and deploy applications to any FaaS provider.

And today, we can't say how proud we are to have received an API Award in the category: Best in Microservices APIs!

#### What are the API Awards?

API World is the largest API conference there is. And so, the 2018 API Awards truly represent technical innovation, adoption, and reception in the API & Microservices industry worldwide.

The Serverless Framework was one chosen out of hundreds of nominations, based on the three criteria used by the judging panel:
1. attention and awareness
2. well-regardedness by the developer & engineering community
3. leadership in its sector for innovation

> Developers and engineers are becoming key influencers in their companies because the technologies they use continue to matter more to their business's operations. Serverless is a great example of a new era of technologies empowering developers to have a greater impact on products and IT. 

_-- Geoff Domoracki, Founder of DevNetwork, producer of API World & the 2018 API Awards_

#### See you at API World!

Serverless will be given an award at the [2018 API Awards](http://apiworld.co/) ceremony on Monday, September 10, 2018. Hope to see you there!
