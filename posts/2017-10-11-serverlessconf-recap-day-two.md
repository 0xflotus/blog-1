## Why the Fuss About Serverless?
by [Simon Wardley](https://twitter.com/swardley)

Simon regaled the crowd with a thoughtful appraisal of how we think about systems—and what this all means for serverless. It was densely packed and every slide was good, so information was kind of flying at our heads. But here are some of his key points: 

**Maps don’t equal Diagrams**<br>
Maps help us better conceptualize problem spaces; we should all be making them. But what most developers call 'maps' (systems maps, anyone?), aren't actually maps.

Maps are more than just a visual; they also need to take into account anchor, position and movement. Imagine if you were to take Australia and plop it down beside Peru. Instantly different globe.

So back to our systems 'map'. It doesn’t have any of those characteristics. Move CRM over to the right? Nothing about the relationship between components change (as there’s no anchor).

We constantly make business decisions using diagrams and not maps, and then are surprised when a gap emerges. We've been doing it wrong. Our diagrams aren't painting a picture of the market landscape.

Simon's solution was to start with a User as his anchor, and draw his map trickling down from that user, on to what that user wanted and needed, then what those needs would require, and so on, until he ended up at the technology that would support those needs.

**We're still following the same patterns**<br>
With every new technology we say: "It'll reduce the budget! It'll eliminate such-and-such role!"

But look. Serverless won’t reduce your IT budget; you’ll just make more stuff. Just like Cloud didn't reduce your IT budget. You made more stuff.

**Adoption is what it is**<br>

Hold tight. Serverless is a great wave, and it's coming. But adoption takes 10-15 years.

So here's where can we expect to be in 2025:
