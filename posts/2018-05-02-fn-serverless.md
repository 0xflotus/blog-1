## Getting Started with Serverless & Fn

Make sure you have the serverless framework installed on your machine.

```bash
# Install serverless framework if you haven't already
npm i serverless -g
```

Then create a new service with the `sls create` command.

```bash
# Create a new Serverless Service/Project
$ serverless create --template NAME-OF-TEMPLE --path new-project
# Change into the newly created directory
$ cd new-project
# Install npm dependencies
$ npm install
```

Fn functions run in Docker containers, therefore you need a running fn service in order to run it.

See the guide on [installing Fn](/framework/docs/providers/fn/guide/installation/) to finish setup.
