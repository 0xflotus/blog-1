On Monday, I joined the Serverless team as the Head of Developer Relations and Experience. A position I am excited to step in to, and one that has me working with you, the community. My work in the serverless space began during the infancy of the FaaS movement. Before "serverless" was a buzzword, before the Serverless Framework even entered its alpha release.

As director of innovation at Trek10 (a Serverless partner!), I worked daily on architecting, building and operating serverless and event-driven architectures. I felt the pain of working on the cutting edge. I relished the moments of seeing someone's eyes light up as serverless clicked for them. I built demos that changed how a company would do business in mere days.

I am joining Serverless, Inc. because I believe in the future that we can build. "We" being Serverless, Inc. the company, and serverless the community. A future that has us building and delivering modern applications that are more resilient, powerful, and cost effective. A future that has us operating applications and services, not infrastructure. A future that has radical focus on business value delivery.

My day to day focus will be working to make sure developers are served by our ecosystem. That we innovate and accommodate in the name of progress. That we continue to be good stewards of the serverless and serviceful future.

The future is always just over the horizon, but there is no other community, or company, I would rather be chasing it with.
