Are you as excited about the possibilities of serverless architectures as we are? Do you stay up at night thinking about serverless architectures and their potential to revolutionize web development? Are you passionate about sharing your knowledge and experience with others? Do you like to write? Let’s connect!

At Serverless Inc. we value the knowledge and experience our community shares through contributing to our open source framework. Writing for the Serverless blog is another way to contribute.

We regularly feature original content from guest contributors on our company blog and Medium. Guest contributors write about a variety of topics including:

* Innovative ways they use serverless architectures
* Success stories from using the Serverless Framework
* Their process, code and experience creating a serverless project
* Insights into serverless architectures
* Helpful How-To content

We want to share your expertise with a global audience of serverless pioneers. Besides appearing on our blog, we feature contributors’ posts across our social media channels and occasionally in our newsletter.

Guest posts include a contributor bio and contact information, including links to social media.

Still with us? Here’s how you can become a contributor.

1. Answer the following questions:

* What’s your favorite blog and why?

* What’s an interesting article you’ve read recently?

2. Submit three writing samples and corresponding GitHub Repos, if relevant.
