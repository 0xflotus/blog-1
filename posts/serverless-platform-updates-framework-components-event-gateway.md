If there's something you want to change about the Serverless Framework, Event Gateway or Components, open an Issue! We even have a [quick & easy guide](https://serverless.com/blog/how-contribute-to-serverless-open-source/) on contributing to Severless open source projects.

[PR reviews](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pulls) are also highly welcomed, as they greatly speed up the time-to-merge.

## Serverless Examples

The [Serverless Examples Repository](https://github.com/serverless/examples) is an excellent resource if you want to explore some real world examples, or learn more about the Serverless Framework and serverless architectures in general.

We have examples for [Components](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/examples) and [Event Gateway](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway/tree/master/examples), too.

## Serverless Plugins

Serverless provides a completely customizable and pluggable codebase. Our community has written a vast amount of awesome plugins you can use to further enhance the capabilities of the Framework. You can find the full list at our [Serverless Plugins Repository](https://github.com/serverless/plugins).

Don't hestitate to open up a PR over there if you have a new Framework plugin to submit!
