## Serverless Examples

The [Serverless Examples Repository](https://github.com/serverless/examples) is an excellent resource if you want to explore some real world examples, or learn more about the Serverless Framework and serverless architectures in general.

We have examples for [Components](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/examples) and [Event Gateway](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway/tree/master/examples), too.

## Serverless Plugins

Serverless provides a completely customizable and pluggable codebase. Our community has written a vast amount of awesome plugins you can use to further enhance the capabilities of the Framework. You can find the full list at our [Serverless Plugins Repository](https://github.com/serverless/plugins).
