One of the hardest parts of getting into the serverless world is understanding the vast offering from one of the many FAAS providers.

From a newbies perspective, there is ALOT happening inside of AWS.

At the time of writing this post, there are **over 74 different products** in the AWS admin console.

SEVENTY-FOUR. Wow. Where to start?

In this post, I'll highlight resources I wish I knew existed when diving into the world of AWS. (in no particular order)

### 1. Amazon Web Services in Plain English

I'm a huge fan of explaining things in a very clear concise way.

Far too many tutorials beat around the bush and/or are overloaded with incomprehensive acroynyms and industry jargon.

Amazon Web Services in Plain English takes a no nonsense approach to describing various AWS product offerings.

### 2. Open Guides - AWS

A boon of trustworthy and practical information and recommendations for a slew of AWS services

Shoutout to https://twitter.com/brianleroux for pointing out this resource to me.

### 3. A Cloud Guru

A cloud guru is a vast library of cloud training material.

Want to learn about AWS services? They got it

Want to learn about Serverless? They got it

Want to learn about DynamoDB? They have a freaking 23 hour course on it!

If you enjoy learning via video, highly recommend checking out their courses

### 4. Cloud Academy

Cloud academy offers a ton of video content as well that is top notch.

They offer a range of learning paths to take you from AWS newbie to AWS Neo

Alfred is one of my favorite productivity apps.

This alfred plugin is super handy for having the AWS docs literally right at your fingertips.

I use this all the time when I am working with a particular AWS sdk and can't remember all the darn methods avialable to me
