re:Invent 2018 has begun! But there is ever so much to track.

If last year is any indication, we expect AWS to have a long list of serverless-centered announcements and launches. If you want to keep up, you've come to the right place.

We're watching all the keynotes and announcements live as they happen, and compiling the "what it is" and the "why it matters" right here. Updating live all week!

Oh, and while you're here, you should [check out our re:Invent virtual hackathon](https://serverless.com/blog/no-server-november-reinvent-hackathon). You can participate from anywhere, even if you're not at the conference, and win prizes while helping non-profits along the way.

#### Announcements

##### Amplify Console

Amplify Console is a deployment & hosting platform for web apps with serverless backends.

##### S3 Batch Operations (preview)

With S3 batch operations, you can operate on a bunch of existing S3 objects, including sending to Lambda.

##### Preview of Aurora Serverless (PostgreSQL)
