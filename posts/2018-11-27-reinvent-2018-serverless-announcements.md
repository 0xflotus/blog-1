re:Invent 2018 has begun! But there is ever so much to track.

If last year is any indication, we expect AWS to have a long list of serverless-centered announcements and launches. If you want to keep up, you've come to the right place.

We're watching all the keynotes and announcements live as they happen, and compiling the "what it is" and the "why it matters" right here. Updating live all week!
