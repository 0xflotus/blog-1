# #Serverless4Life

We care a lot about open source. Like, a _lot_. You all in the serverless community are the best we've seen. Period.

And some of you? Blow our freaking minds with your unrelenting commitment to the future of computing.

It was on a day not so long ago, as we were sweeping our mind-fragments off the floor for the dozenth time, in awe at your majesty, that we realized what we had to do. "These people deserve an award!" we said. Just like that. *These people deserve an award.*

So we made one. Today, serverless community, we are so, SO proud to announce: The **Serverless Champions** program.

## What is a Serverless Champion?

A Serverless Champion is a hero in the serverless community. They contribute to open-source serverless projects. They speak at serverless conferences and meetups. They help newcomers get excited. They crawl the forums just looking for questions to answer.

They are thought leaders, teachers, and builders.

Four times a year, we will select three new Serverless Champions to join the ranks. We are going to put your smiling face on our website and make a Pretty Big Deal about it. We're gonna give you limited-edition swag & access to an invitation-only Slack channel. 

And gosh there are tons more goodies but we kind of don't want to spoil it all in this blog post. Just go check out our [Serverless Champions page]() already.

# And the very first cohort of Serverless Champions are! (drumroll)
