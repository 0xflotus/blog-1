Ah, November. The month of re:Invent, pumpkin spice, and now: the #noServerNovember challenge.

Every week this month, we're releasing some Serverless Challenges that are designed to help experienced users level up, and brand new users get started. Do one, or three, for fun in your spare time!

If you do any of the challenges and tweet a link to your GitHub repo with the hashtag #noServerNovember, you just might win some official Serverless swag.

Be sure to [check the rules](#rules) before submitting!

#### The challenges

##### Nov 5: Serverless Ipsum, DadBot, GitHub Check

We've got three challenges this week to suit all levels! The Serverless Ipsum challenge can be done even if you've never set up an AWS account before, and have never coded anything in your life.

Every challenge you complete gets you one entry into the drawing.

*Beginner track*

**Build a Serverless Ipsum generator.**

Build a simple serverless-backed web app that displays Serverless Ipsum when it is loaded. Or Tony Danza Ipsum. Or The Office Ipsum. Or Reasons-I-Can’t-Take-Out-The-Trash Ipsum. 

As long as it looks like Lorem Ipsum, but uses different words, we’re good. The page doesn’t have to look fancy, and you can do this even if you’ve never coded anything in your life!

Here’s a tutorial to get you started:
* [I just deployed a Serverless app—and I can’t code](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-deployed-a-serverless-app-and-i-cant-code-here-s-how-i-did-it-94983d7b43bd)

Plus, some inspiration for all of you not-a-developer-yet-but-learning types:
* [From chef to Serverless developer in 4 years](https://serverless.com/blog/from-chef-to-serverless-developer-in-4-years/)

How to submit to the Serverless Ipsum challenge:
1. Tweet the link to your GitHub repo and your Ipsum webpage.
2. Include the hashtag #noServerNovember.

*Intermediate/Advanced track (fun version)*

**Make a Twitter bot that tweets dad jokes.**

Write a serverless-backed Twitter bot. Make it tweet dad jokes. That’s really all there is to it.

Here are some helpful links to get you started:
* [A dad jokes API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api)
* [Write a Twitter Wordpress AWS Lambda bot](https://garywoodfine.com/twitter-wordpress-aws-lambda-bot/)
* [Write a Twitter bot using Microsoft Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/2017/06/01/deploying-bots-using-the-serverless-framework/)

How to submit to the DadBot Twitter challenge:
1. Tweet the link to your GitHub repo and your DadBot account.
2. Include the hashtag #noServerNovember.

*Intermediate/Advanced track (actually useful (!!!) version)*

**Automate a GitHub Check with Serverless.**

This project is one of our favorites around the office, for its sheer usability. Automating anything to do with GitHub is just incredibly useful.

For the easy version, set up a GitHub check that makes sure there’s a reference to a GitHub / Jira / etc issue in the PR title. For the harder version, set up a GitHub check to automatically lint & reformat your code on a new commit.

Or, do something else fun. We’ll leave this open-ended.

Here are some resources to get you started:
* [GitHub Checks documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/)
* [Set up a serverless GitHub webhook](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-github-webhook-slack/)
* [See the GitHub webhook example in our Examples Explorer](https://serverless.com/examples/aws-node-github-webhook-listener)
* [How to build a GitHub bot](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-github-bot-with-phantomjs-react-and-serverless-framework-7b66bb575616)

How to submit to the GitHub Check challenge:
1. Tweet the link to your GitHub repo with a screenshot of the Check in action.
2. Include the hashtag #noServerNovember.

**Nov 12:** *???*

**Nov 19:** *???*

**Nov 26:** *Special Edition: re:Invent serverless hackathon*

#### How it works

The first three Mondays in November, we'll release a new set of Serverless Challenges. We’ll also include some resources to get you started. The final week of November, we'll have a special edition re:Invent hackathon instead.

Find a challenge you like! Or better yet, find multiple challenges you like! You can enter separately for every challenge you complete, and you can complete any challenge at any time.

Do the challenge. Put it in GitHub. Tweet a link to your repo, plus any other relevant links or screenshots, with the hashtag #NoServerNovember. 

Each entry qualifies you to win a prize. We will draw three winners every week, and we don't remove you from the pool until you win a prize. So if you complete a challenge during week 1, you could be in the drawing for weeks 2 and 3 as well. All the more reason to start early!

Draw dates:
- Nov. 12
- Nov. 19
- Nov. 26

#### Rules

To qualify, the entry must use the Serverless Framework and a serverless backend (such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Microsoft Azure).

You may only enter one time per daily challenge. You can, however, complete as many daily challenges as you want, and those will count as separate entries.

You must follow any additional instructions contained within the challenge descriptions to have your entry counted.
Only entries that use the hashtag #noServerNovember will be qualified to win.
