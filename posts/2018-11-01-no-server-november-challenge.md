No Server November: Join the #noServerNovember challenge!

Ah, November. The month of re:Invent, pumpkin spice, and now: the #noServerNovember challenge.

Every week this month, we're releasing some Serverless Challenges that are designed to help experienced users level up, and brand new users get started. Do one, or three, for fun in your spare time!

If you do any of the challenges and tweet a link to your GitHub repo with the hashtag #noServerNovember, you just might win some official Serverless swag.

#### The challenges

**Nov 5:** *???*

**Nov 12:** *???*

**Nov 19:** *???*

**Nov 26:** *Special Edition: re:Invent serverless hackathon*

#### How it works

The first three Mondays in November, we'll release a new Serverless Challenge or two. Weâ€™ll also include some resources to get you started. The final week of November, we'll have a special edition re:Invent hackathon instead.

Find a challenge you like! Or better yet, find multiple challenges you like! You can enter separately for every challenge you complete, and you can complete any challenge at any time.

Do the challenge. Put it in GitHub. Tweet a link to your repo, plus any other relevant links or screenshots, with the hashtag #noServerNovember. 

Each entry qualifies you to win a prize. We will draw three winners every week, and we don't remove you from the pool until you win a prize. So if you complete a challenge during week 1, you could be in the drawing for weeks 2 and 3 as well. All the more reason to start early!

Draw dates:
- Nov. 12
- Nov. 19
- Nov. 26

#### Rules

To qualify, the entry must use the Serverless Framework and a serverless backend (such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Microsoft Azure).

You may only enter one time per daily challenge. You can, however, complete as many daily challenges as you want, and those will count as separate entries.

You must follow any additional instructions contained within the challenge descriptions to have your entry counted.
Only entries that use the hashtag #noServerNovember will be qualified to win.
