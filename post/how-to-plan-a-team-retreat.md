At Serverless we made a conscience decision early on that we would like to take advantage of finding top talent outside of San Francisco so that we can avoid the intense competition for talent in the Bay Area and hire team members in areas with a much lower cost of living. This has lead to our company having a mix of about 50% of team members in San Francisco and another 50% distributed across North America and Europe. Of course along with their benefits, distributed teams also have their own unique challenges. Hello, trying to find a good time to schedule all-hands meetings when your team spans 18 time zones.

In order to keep everybody on the same page we rely on asynchronous communication channels such as Slack and Github, but even then, our distributed team members lack access to the daily lunches and passing conversations that happen in the San Francisco office, which can leave them feeling isolated and out of the loop on daily decisions. 

One of the ways that we ensure that the entire team is involved in big decisions and has input on culture and process is through our biannual team retreats. Our January team retreat takes place in Northern California, which helps keep costs lower since we have less people that need to fly in and our July retreat takes place closer to our distributed team members. Past locations include Austria and Morocco. Yes, you read that right, we did a team retreat in July in Morocco during a heat wave. Let's just say it was a bonding experience and we spent a lot of time in the swimming pool.

Over the last couple years we've learned some important lessons on how to maximize team retreats and make sure that we are getting a high return on investment.

**Have a goal in mind**

Knowing what we want to accomplish on our team retreat informs our work sessions, team outings, and even downtime. By having these clear goals and themes going into the retreat we are able to send out the agenda ahead of time for team members to review and prepare for each session.

For example, at the end of 2016 we had some changes in leadership that left several distributed team members feeling out of the loop. We realized that we needed to use our team retreat to ensure that everybody was aligned and working toward the same goals. The retreat agenda focused on reviewing the company mission, defining our team values, and spending a lot of time doing team building activities to establish trust and comraderie.

In the six months following the retreat our team members felt more aligned and we were able to make swift progress toward larger goals, but we realized that we had some serious issues with our product process. Our July retreat in Morocco was focused almost entirely on improving the way we do product. There were several days of intense conversations, but at the end of the week we had solved a lot of the pain points and implemented a framework loosely based on human centered design.

**Measure success**

Of course we wouldn't know how successful our team retreats are without analyzing some data. 

We use [Officevibe](https://www.officevibe.com/) to keep a finger on the pulse of team happiness and engagement on a weekly basis. The normal trend of team engagement includes a big spike in satisfaction right after a team retreat and then as the months go on all the good vibes and trust established in face to face interactions start to diminish as we all fall back into our normal day-to-day routines. We've found that the six month cadence is good timing to keep the team at a positive level of engagement.

We also measure the success of our team retreats by sending out a survey before and after the retreat. When using the net promoter score to test for team alignment during our Q1 2017 retreat we saw a big jump in team members feeling aligned. The change was palpable in team meetings following the retreat where team members were more positive overall and focused on how to make a solution work versus why an idea wouldn't work.

We also use these feedback loops to constantly improve our retreats. We include the questions, "What did you love? What could have been better? What should we do next time?" on each of our post retreat surveys. Based on this feedback we've improved communication leading up to retreats and at our next retreat we're planning on bringing a facilitator to help us work through processes more efficiently. 

**Have fun!**

All work and no play makes Serverless team members very dull indeed. It would be cruel to ask all of our team members to travel halfway around the world just to sit in a conference room all day. That's why we always try to find cool retreat locations with easy to access recreation. One of our best memories as a team was hiking [Hendy Woods](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=438) in Philo, California after a huge rainstorm. We had quite the adventure navigating the flooded trail through the redwoods hanging with all a bunch of salamanders out for a swim. In Morocco we took advantage of the large pool at our villa to get some volleyball games going in between meetings. 

Evenings during retreats usually include board games, jam sessions or several rounds of Mafia. Because nothing builds a team up faster than calling each other liars and pretending to kill each other off one-by-one.

These moments of communal downtime are just as important as any work sessions we organize. They remind us of how much we like each other as people, not just teammates and helps build a strong foundation of trust and respect. These moments are especially important in cultivating empathy between team members. Sometimes it's easy to forget that the person on the other end of the Slack channel is a human being with a family, hobbies, and obligations, but through our team retreats we build real friendships that encourage us to constantly support each other.

These are just a few ways that we make sure we are getting the maximum return on our team retreats. If you'd like to see our Retreat Planning Guide check out our [Company Handbook](https://github.com/serverless/culture).
